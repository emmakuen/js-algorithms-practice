# Binary Heap

<small>Insertion O(logn), Deletion - O(logn), Get Root - O(1), Search - O(n)</small><br/>
<small>Space - O(n)</small>

- Tree structure which is either min heap or max heap.
- In the min heap, root must be the minimum among all values in the heap and parents must be smaller than the children
- In the max heap, root must be the maximum among all values in the heap and parents must be larger than the children
- No implied ordering among siblings

## Use Cases

- Heap sort, priority queues, graph traversal algorithms (Dijkstra's shortes path etc.)
