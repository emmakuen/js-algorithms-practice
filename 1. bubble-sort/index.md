# Bubble Sort

<small>Time complexity: worst O(n2), average Θ(n2), best Ω(n)</small><br/>
<small>Space complexity: O(1)</small>

- It sorts a list of items in memory by repeatedly comparing each pair of adjacent items and swapping them if they're out of order util the list is sorted.
- In bubble sort, low values bubble to the top and large values sink to the bottom (to the end of the list).

## Advantages

- Easy to understand and implement
- Data is sorted in place, so it doesn't require lots of additional memory
- Data is ready for processing in memory after the sort

## Disadvantages

- Bubble sort is slow compared to other sorting algorithms.
